# TileVania
TileVania is a fast-paced game where you play as our player "BaltacÄ±". My game consists of three levels. Levels gets harder as you play through the game. To prevent gameSession script to generate over again on the level change i have used singelton desing pattern on my game to get right information about our score, lives left and ammos left.

From this link you can watch the gameplay of the game.
